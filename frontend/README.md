# Development Notes

**The application will be composed in the following way:**

Three categories:

    -   Personal finance
    -   Business finance
    -   Economics

Each category will have multiple topics and each topic will have the 4 following things:

    1. A description
    2. An example
    3. Visuals
    4. An exercise

The description:

    Simple, clear, and concise. Used for the purpose of introducing topics and touching on their real world application.

The examples and visuals:

    Used for the purpose of teaching how to apply the topics to the real world.
    Examples and visuals may be used as together for this one purpose.

The exercise:

    Each exercise will be different due to the nature of the topic, but every exercise (or at least most) should have some basic shared properties such as input and output as well as images and/or understanding questions.

Note: Consider topics as "skills"

Future features:

    -   A personal dashboard where users can use tools for the real world as well as track their finances for any of the applicable topics learned. Will most likely utilize third party services and tools.
